Subject: NTS Plotting Implementation - Possible Solution

Dear Dr. Rachev,

I hope this email finds you well. I am not originally part of the project team, but I have recently been experimenting with Claude Code and saw the discussion about the NTS plotting challenges. I wanted to see if it could help sort this issue.

I was able to fork the temStaPy and temStaR repositories that Dr. Kim shared and successfully run the code through Claude Code. I have generated plots for Figure 4.4(a) showing the NTS PDFs with the parameter configurations from your email thread (prior, high/low volatility, right skew, thick tails, and location shift, along with the N(0,1) reference).

Please note that these may not be entirely correct, as I am not familiar with the full theoretical background, but I am attaching them in case they are helpful.

I have also created a GitHub repository documenting the entire process:
- Working Python implementation using temStaPy
- Generated plots (PNG and PDF formats, 300 DPI)
- Comprehensive sanity checks and validation results
- Full documentation of the parameter mappings used

GitHub Repository: https://github.com/akashdeepo/NTS_Plotting_Solution

The CGMY-to-NTS parameter conversion I used may need verification against the theoretical relationships in the literature. Please feel free to review, modify, or disregard as appropriate. I hope this helps in some way.

Best regards,
Akash Deep
